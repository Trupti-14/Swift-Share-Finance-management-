Swift Share â€“ Finance Management ðŸ’¸

Tech Stack: Java, DSA, OOPs.
This project was developed during Buffer 6.0, a DSA-based project-making competition conducted by Club Loop, MKSSSâ€™s Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Pune.

I actively contributed with my teammates to build Swift Share, a Java-based application designed to manage and simplify group expense tracking.

âœ… Equal and Unequal Bill Splitting: Users can split bills either equally or based on individual contributions.
ðŸ“– Transaction History: Maintains a detailed log of all expenses and splits for transparency.
ðŸ†” Unique Member IDs: Each group member gets a unique ID to manage records accurately.

The entire project was built using Java, applying strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for efficient performance.
